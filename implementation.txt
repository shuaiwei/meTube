transfer images,videos and audios by session, in 3 places, the values will be changed,
1. search
2. all medias browser
3. personal medias browser.
4. search has nothing to do with username.

Var ifEdit decide edit or just browser.  

Not only image clicking can jump to singleMediaBrowser
But also metaUpdate can do that.

User can not comment and score his media, he can edit his own when searching result including his.

By deciding if owner and browser is the same person, we use different showing and dealing page.
